## May 13 2024 - MORNING

Welcome to my second project in master’s thesis. Here I’ll be exploring about sex, physics and humour which should be really COOL. I’m doing this project in partnership with Club Sexu thanks to good old Elspeth McConnell (a small Concordia grant supporting projects with non-profit organizations). The idea is to make a sexy funny game about pleasure, listening to your partner and exploring pleasure with them. Them being a webpage. How can you pleasure a webpage? The entire page? 

I’m will be using matter.js as part of this project and taking inspiration from the relief humour theory to make it funny. 

Brainstorm 1 -

Relief theory + sex + physics engine…. this all seems to make sense. 

The relief theory explains laughter as a release of pent up energy. Like something hat needs no be exteriorized in response to maybe mal aise or taboo or being uncomfortable…. For me this makes me think of an orgasm almost. And matterjs seems to be a good library to explore this through in part, because well it deals with physical things, litteral bodies, and friction and other things that are all part of the sexual language in a sense. So yeah. All this feels tied together in some sort.

I’m also directly thinking about my first ever programming project, “the most incredible programming experience in the world” or something like that, I don’t really remember to be honest. In this really simple project, a series of animated interactive slides would appear one after the other, the player has to click to go to the next one, or do somekind of weird simple activity. Each slide would be talking about what the project itself is, like a trailer of some kind, saying things like “what you are going to experience is the most exciting thing to ever happen to programming…” and building up more and more expectations about what that thing would eventually be. Acoompanying this (very importantly), is the song Opus by Eric Prydz, which already is hilarious because of it has the longest most intense montée in a song that I ever heard. All in all the player starts to find it funny I THINK because everything builds up and they cannot wait for what is going to happen, which is nothing basically, but the point was to make them invested and believe that something huge was coming.

I think playing with a similar arc would definitely be something to think about, a sort of build up. A sexual build up of sorts. Makes me think of Robert Yang’s stick shift, where you have to stick shift a manual car for a dude that gets off more and more as the vitesses go up from 1 to 4, but you have to be careful because if you make a mistake then you start over. 

Im thinking of creating a page, where you have to explore to make the page more and more horny, by doing various things to it. I KNOW IM COPYING PIPPIN BAR. But mine wouldn’t be an interface. The window you are pleasuring would be more experimental, and you would need to explore it to find out how to turn it on, using different things on your computer. Like tickling using the keyboard. Rubbing it in certain ways, maybe even talking to it. Basically get to know it through physicality. There could be sex toys made with matterjs as well. I could start by making a series of matterjs sex toys haha. Yes. Yes yes. 

ANOTHER idea that I would like to implement in this is pop ups. I really want to do something with pop ups. I love them. Maybe opening a bunch of pop ups and closing them in the right order makes the page horny. Or maybe slowing resizing them. OMG thats good. This is actually giving me an idea : you can make a pop up open more and more if you do the right thing, and this pop up reveals something of sorts, a hole maybe? in which you can use the matter js sex toy to pleasure it?? I like the idea of using all the affordances of a web page to make it horny. The sound design of this is going to be awesome to make. I want hot genderless machine sounds. 

I also dont want to make it too interaction designy, more like a weird colorful experience. 

So yeah :

- An arc that pents up energy with a final release
- Browser affordances as sexual foreplay (opening a pop up slowly)
- Matter.js bodies as sex toys or mecanisms for giving pleasure
- Minimal design, basic shapes and colour palette - reminiscent of sexual shapes? metaphor for sex through visuals.

BASICALLY : The player has to *listen* to the webpage in order to pleasure it. It talks to the player through pop ups - and the player has to adjust its behavior in order to make it through the experience. The player also gets asked questions so that both feel they are building something special together? I think it's nice to create something that makes the player feel like their pleasure is also taken into consideration by the page. The page can ask the player if they prefer opening the window fast or slow, or what kind of tools or action they like (or preferred) so they can also feel like their voice is important in building the tension. Try to create a sensation of togetherness, working together. 

Things that happen in sex : 
- Having to take a break to talk
- When you really connect you cum faster
- Sometimes toys or narratives or roleplaying can help to get into it or build connection
- Trying new things can be exciting
- Doing things you are used to can be comforting 
- You remember what the person likes and do it again and start liking it as well 

actions that could become sexual:
- Dark mode = more kinky? (faster or more rough things)
- Typing keyboard fast vs slow = finding a rythm to pleasure the page
- Opening, closing pop ups with a rythm as well, or in the right order
- Pressing buttons 
- Resizing pop ups 
- breathing heavily = growing in size or pulsing rapidly 
- Sounds = breathing and groaning but in a computer way (robot ish?)
- MATTER.JS :
  - The page drops toys and player must do something with it
  - Mechanisms to give pleasure 
  - More the meaty part of sex? Everything else is foreplay but when using matter.js it is more intense in reactions from the page
  - Mechanisms that are sex without being explicit?? But they feel like sex? 

Where do I start. I feel like I need to experiment for the week with a bunch of small things, and by friday I need to have a scope for this project with deliverables. Ideally this project will be somewhat complete before I leave for ICELAND. So what are the first experiments I want to make. I feel like I have to think of it as the player will experience it a bit. I'm thinking the game will probably start with a couple of small interactions. And become more and more complex until the page (and the player?) cums. 

So. First experiment. Make a page that opens up a pop up and the player has to open it fast or slow according to the color changes of the background color. Ok makes sense. Yes. Lets go. do this. 

## May 15 2024 - AFTERNOON

Todo be4 stopping work -
- Have 3 levels implemented
- A gauge instead of numbers
- A start button that opens the window and starts game 
- a signal faster, slower, good...
- "Resize me" in the window 

## May 21 2024 - AFTERNOON

ATM I have a system where the user has to resize the window at a specific speed, depending on the level, and it feels linear in a way that is a bit boring, from slow to fast. Feels correct to start slowly, but maybe there could be more randomness. Like start slow and probably end fast, but in between, alternate between fast and slow?

Other thing that is boring as of now:
- The communication system of speed is just words printed and changing erratically between slow, good and fast, and there is just a simple gauge going up and down. Its not super interesting and dynamic imo. I have this idea of communicating with popups...... Dunno what could be fun.
- Also, there is no physics at this point, which doesn't really respect the whole idea of using matter.js .................
- Theres no sound........... 
- I hate it here
  
  What to work on :
  - How to communicate the speed the player should resize in an interesting way
  - How to communcate progress or bigger changes in speed bracket
  - Incorporating physics
  - Incorporating sound

I guess at this point I could also maybe take a step back and think about what this IS in a sense. I feel like its lacking a direction and narrative which is fine because for the most part at this point I just wanted to test the mechanics of resizing at a specific speed and see what that could do, but now I think I need a bit more meat around that to make it funny. I think the funny would come in as how the pleasure is expressed by the page to the user.  

Ok so I just went to play "It is as if you were making love" and it is literally the same thing that I did except for me it is about resizing. UHHHUHUHUHSUAHDIJNASJKFNDJKSNFJKNSAJKFNJ. 
OK.

OK. 

ok I need to start something else because I am feeling not good about all of this. Ok. 

I need to rebrainstorm. And read more about the relief theory and start working directly with matter.js.


## May 27 2024 - MORNING
I decided to actually take a step back in terms of I wanna say originality or innovation? I felt like I needed to go back to something more contained in terms of starting board. So here we are, with a 800x800 p5js canvas in the middle of the screen with a matter.js engine running. It made me feel safe to feel in control of what was happeing, not having random popups and weird mechanics that are hard to make safe or working for users. Ultimately I want to try to get away from being constrained to a simple canvas but I think for the sake of this project (making something that will work as research about humour and matter js, as well as work for Club Sexu), I need to scale back in terms of weirdness of mechanics and stuff. And also, there is now a bigger focus on matter.js as a library.

The first thing I wanted to do was to make anal beads. Hahaha. when visiting the matter.js website I kept seeing this:

![matter js chain image](journal_assets/matterjs_chain.png)
And I've really been thinking about making a chain as anal beads coming out of a butt, where the user has to pull it out basically, or even putting it back in? Altough this seems more complex. 
Anyways, so I did this thing and it sort of *works*.

![Anal Beads 1](journal_assets/gifs/anal_beads_1.gif)

 I like it but the mechanics are not perfect obviously. Right now its too simple to pull it all out at the same time. I think my goal right now is to add some sort of realism to it, reactions and sounds but keep the visuals really minimalistic. I think it would maybe be nice to have to again adjust the speed, or maybe even rubbing the butt before popping one out. Something. Like it is stuck in there and you have to do something to get it out?

I want to implement a small simple game mechanic and focus on making the whole thing really sexy. I want like ASMR sex sounds haha. 

Alssooooo. I got this idea of like MAYBE playing on the porn website aesthetics... like there's always CRAZY taglines and phrases and ads and stuff. I think it could be funny to play into that. Things like:
 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYPS_r8773o

Ok I need to start a list of taglines of ads on pornsites :
- "Hey you, do you want to masturbate but don't have a partner? 
- "This is so much better than watching a porn video...If you tap, you will cum!"

I'm thinking about having a couple different small experiments like this one, that combined would make a small game, or maybe just building off of this one and making it more complex? We shall see. Club Sexu would also play a role in deciding the sort of final form of the project, even though I could branch out of that at some point if it prevents me of making something that would feel benificial to my research. As of now I feel the freedom to explore everything I would do if this was not part of a contract.

## May 28 2024 - MORNING

Added bounce to the bum to make it more realistic. At first I thought I was going to just make them vibrate of some sorts... but then uppon stumbling again on the matter.js home page, i saw a demo of a chain as a bridge. As I was playing with it, I tought: OH!! I should take advantage of this bouncing in matter.js for the bum!!! 

![anal beads 2 gif](journal_assets/gifs/other_gifs/matter_bridge.gif)

So I made a chain like this one but with only two circle particles instead of a series of rectangles like in the example. Both ends are then tied with invisible static constraints. I then had to adjust the stiffness and length of each constraint. I also adjusted the density of the beads and the bum so that the bum would have the perfect bounce when going out. I also wanted the beads to not completely separate the bum, so I needed to test a lot to make the perfect sensitivity when colliding. TADAM :

![anal beads 2 gif](journal_assets/gifs/anal_beads_2.gif)

## June 3rd 2024 - MORNING

I added collision filters to all my bodies, because at the player could click on the bum and pull it, and the cheeks would then separate and reveal that its just two circles. I needed to deactivate the mouse on the bum. I also added started running into a problem, where the player could slide the balls on the side making the entire toy slide sideways and come disappear entirely. I decided to try to build a sort of tunnel with two static rectangles, and adjust the masks of the collision filters to deactivate collision once the bead goes past a certain point in the canvas. I also switched to a longer canvas to make it easier to pull down. 

Next is color, sounds and slap on the cheeks when clicking.

## June 5th 2024 - AFTERNOON

Initially I had decided to continue the anal beads experiment, but I felt like I should start a second one, because I had an idea and felt like I should try it fassst. I'm realizing that I can try things pretty quickly now. I should prioritize this instead of really focusing on details. I mean right now I sort of have an idea of where I want to go with this:

"Are you alone?" is a collection of 2D interactive erotic web experiences. Inspired by the absurd nature of online sex games promoted as invasive popup ads (on porn websites?), they result from a research-creation process exploring the use of humor theory as a motivating material to design interactions with different JavaScript libraries. Developed in partnership with Club Sexu, "Are you alone?" provides a subversive, playful experience for the user at the intersection of eroticism and humor. This iteration uses Matter.js, a physics engine for 2D physics on the web, to facilitate playful interaction. SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES.

Like theres a menu with the choices, and there is the voice on loop saying "ARE YOU ALONE? You won't last 5 minutes playing this game" and other similar catchphrases. then you can open the games and play them maybe in different popups? 

ANYWAYS i just wanted to write this somewhere but here is where I am at in terms of actual work.

## June 6th 2024 - MORNING

When I was first doing the anal beads, I was trying to work with matter js composites for the first time to make a chain instead of manually building it from individual bodies and adding constraints. I took an example from the documentation and ended up doing this:

![anal beads 2 gif](journal_assets/gifs/other_gifs/composite_test.gif)

And I thought it looked almost liquidy, and I thought if I add some ellipses then maybe we will get the illusion of something more organic, like a soft thing. I knew something interesting could be done with this but I put it aside to work on the beads again. But then I decided to think about what I could make with this: A SOFT PENIS!!!! Soft penis are like already funny in a sense. And you also don't really usually to play with one. I also really fast decided to add a cloth on top as a sort of skirt that can be pulled up? I thought, that could be the sort of "game" of this one. You can play with the dick but also reveal it from under the skirt or something. It plays with expectations and would add a surprise element. I'm thinking the static ellipses at the top could be buttons that if clicking on them, they unbutton and the cloth falls and then you can play with the penis. Of course in this case the cloth would be opaque (checkered? like a kilt).

![anal beads 2 gif](journal_assets/gifs/penis/penis_1.gif)

So I was playing with this idea, testing different things, making the penis heavier, longer, shorter, to see what felt most realistic. I started adding visual details (a cock ring, a more pointy head) and then I made a mistake working with collision filters and the cloth started to come in contact with the penis, sort of holdins it together, creating a 3D-like effect of a mesh underwear holding a giant shlong and I think this is where I crossed the line of comedy and went to the sexual side. 

![anal beads 2 gif](journal_assets/gifs/penis/penis_2.gif)

It was weird because it was hot and I thought it was funny because I was surprised by it, and the fact that it is over sexual makes it funny im my mind (but maybe only because I'm making it?), but not in all context??? Like it's funny because I'm making this and it's going to be presented out of its context, but if this was on a porn page, I don't know if people would necessarily find it funny. I think it still is but I realized that I needed to cut back on making it realistic. I feel like I pushed the realism too much and the humourous line playing off of the ambiguity between sexual and abstract wasnt so blurry anymore. It was funny because it was crass and very sexual. The subtility was gone. It was just a big floppy dick instead of something suggested. I'm not trying to make something ACTUALLY sexual. Well. I think it's nice if you have the choice to find it sexual or funny. And if its too realistic than its too much on the sexual side. Compared to the first one (beads), the simplicity of just using circles and lines made it perfectly straddle the line of sexy and funny. Like you could play this in public. This I would not. IMO this means that it strays away from being funny. I decided to pull back and see what was up without the cloth, but even then, I thought there is too much details and it crosses the line on the sexual side. ALSO I think that each "game" should have one "toy-like" element, and here the cock ring is not interactive, but still a toy, making it a bit confusing and not necessary and also constributing to making it very sexual. 

![anal beads 2 gif](journal_assets/gifs/penis/penis_3.gif)

So I pulled back again and now I'm here:

![anal beads 2 gif](journal_assets/gifs/penis/penis_4.gif)

I like the simplicity of this, and I think that with the skirt element this could be really fun. I really want to make the skirt NOW but since I know its going to be awesome I'll wait for a day when I'm depresed to do it, and since I have good energy, I want to try to start making a third one with a vulva. I think this is probably going to be more challenging, because first of all I don't know vulvas too well, and also I think that they are not necessarily funny? Like a soft dick is funny but a vulva is not. So yeah. I think the first thing I actually want to try to make is a vibrator. I think that if I make a chain with really tight constraints it creates a vibrating effect and I think it could be interesting.  Moral of the story : realism is OK in terms of physics (makes it funny), but realism in terms of visuals is a thin line to make things overly sexual. ALSO, I think sounds will play a big part in making this more ridiculous.
